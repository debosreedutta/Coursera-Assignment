                        <p>
                            The dish was developed in 1947 by founders of Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India. The dish was made "by chance" by mixing the leftover chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter and cream. In 1974, a recipe was published for "Murgh Makhani" (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)". In 1975, the English phrase "butter chicken" first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan.[11] In Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling. The dish is common in India and many other countries. Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt) Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala and ginger garlic paste. The chicken is usually cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato- and onion-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is finally velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cream may be used in the sauce or as a garnish. Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and is finally garnished with coriander.

                        <p>
                            Chilli Mushroom recipe is a delectable appetizer recipe, which can be prepared at home without putting in much efforts. Soak the mushrooms in some lukewarm water for sometime and then drain the excess water. Then take another bowl and mix together corn flour, all purpose flour, salt, soy sauce, vinegar and pepper powder in it. Once the mixture is ready, add the mushrooms in the bowl and mix well. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium flame. Fry the coated mushrooms until golden brown and crisp. Remove and drain the excess oil. Keep 1-2 tsp oil in the pan and remove the excess. Add ginger, garlic, onions and green chillies in the pan and saute for a minute or two. Once the onions turn slightly translucent, add the red chilli sauce and little water, if desired. Once the red gravy is cooked, add the mushrooms and stir well. Cook the mushrooms until all moisture has evaporated and then transfer the dish to a serving bowl. Garnish with coriander leaves and spring onions. Pair it with cola or any summer beverage. Enjoy! You can also use this dish as a stuffing for your rolls like Kathi Roll, Veg Spring rolls or as a mix for your homemade fried rice. If you are fond of smokiness of onion, garlic, then stir fry these ingredients on high flame. It tastes best when served with Hakka Noodles, Fried Rice or Manchurian etc. Remember to serve small portions of this snack as it is quite filling. this recipe with baby portabella mushrooms. you can also use white button mushrooms. Pic below is of these mushrooms. Being more earthy and having a meaty texture, they work well in recipes like these. Heat oil for shallow frying in a kadai or wok. Dip each mushroom slice in the batter and coat uniformly with the batter. Add them to the medium hot oil and fry till they are slight golden and crisp.

                        <p>
                            Paneer tikka masala[1] is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy curry sauce.[2] A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken.[3][4] The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as purée), cream, coconut cream and spices like many versions of its namesake masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato purée or with food dye. The dish shares some similarity with butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance. On a typical dark, wet Glasgow night, a bus driver coming off shift came in and ordered a paneer curry. He sent it back to the waiter saying it's dry. At the time, Dad had an ulcer and was enjoying a plate of tomato soup. So he said why not put some tomato soup into the curry with some spices. They sent it back to the table and the bus driver absolutely loved it. He and his friends came back again and again and we put it on the menu. In July 2009, then British Member of Parliament Mohammad Sarwar tabled an Early Day Motion in the House of Commons asking that Parliament support a campaign for Glasgow to be given European Union protected geographical status for paneer tikka masala. Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt) Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala and ginger garlic paste. The paneer is usually cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato- and onion-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated.

Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cream may be used in the sauce or as a garnish. Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and is finally garnished with coriander.
